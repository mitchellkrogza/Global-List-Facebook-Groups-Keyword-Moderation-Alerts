## How to Use

The Facebook Keyword Alerts allows input of a comma separated (csv) list of keyworks. For this purpose we create and update the facebook-groups-keywords.csv file on each update. This makes it easy to update your keywords alerts in your Facebook Group. (always download the RAW file of the .csv)

If you don't want all the words then simply pick selectively from the plain text list facebook-groups-keywords.txt
